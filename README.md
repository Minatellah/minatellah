# About Me

I am a student passionate about **Statistics** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong interest in understanding the **theoretical foundations** behind every concept. My goal is not just to apply methods, but to deeply grasp why they work and how they can be extended.

This repository showcases my **self-driven projects** exploring statistical concepts and machine learning techniques. Each project demonstrates my ability to **analyze data, implement models, and interpret results**, while reflecting my curiosity and rigor in learning.

## Highlights

- Projects illustrating **core statistical methods**.  
- **Machine Learning experiments** in Python and R, including model building and evaluation.  
- Demonstrating data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.  
- Notes and proofs for key theoretical results, showing attention to **conceptual understanding**.

I created this repository to document my work, share my approach, and provide evidence of my **analytical skills and motivation** for advanced studies in statistics and Aritificial Intelligence.

##  Goal
My goal is to strengthen my skills in Statistics, Econometrics, and programming and to build a strong portfolio for the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
